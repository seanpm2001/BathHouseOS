# BathHouseOS

## MaprilOS

### About

MaprilOS is a subsystem of BathHouseOS, designed for making any shower more advanced. It is named after an old portmanteau I made in Elementary School, which is the combination of April and May. This reflects that April **Showers** bring May flowers.

### Features

#### ThoughtPad

A place to write down shower thoughts, and continue your shower without getting out. Let the ideas flow!

Optional: you can register your shower thoughts with the ThoughtPad registry.

#### Hot water gauge

See how much hot water is left, limit how much hot water you use.

#### Temperature gauge

See (separately) the temperature of cold water and hot water, along with the combined temperature (the default is set to Celsius, but it can be switched to Fahrenheit, Rankine, or Kelvin) and a separate meter for the average shower temperature by threshold

#### Automatic turnoff

Turn the shower off after a set amount of time

#### AutoOff

Turn the shower off by simply walking out of it, walk over the sensors of the door to de-activate the shower.

## Home repositories

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MaprilOS/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main BathHouseOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
