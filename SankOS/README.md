# BathHouseOS

## SankOS

### About

SankOS is a subsystem of BathHouseOS, designed for making sinks more advanced. This feature isn't exclusive to bathrooms, but is still part of the BathHouseOS operating system family.

I would call it SinkOS, but that sounds too similar to Sync OS, and would be generic. The I was substituted with an A, as sank is a very similar word, and as close as I can get to sink.

### Features

#### Temperature gauge

See separately the temperature of cold water and hot water, along with the combined temperature (the default is set to Celsius, buut it can be switched to Fahrenheit, Rankine, or Kelvin) and a separate meter for the average washing temperature by threshold

#### Automatic turnoff

Turn the sink off after a set amount of time

#### Soap dispenser

Enable/disable a soap dispenser

#### Towel dispenser

Enable/disable a towel dispenser (paper, cloth, or other type (undefined))

Change the flushing direction

## Home repositories

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SankOS/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main BathHouseOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
