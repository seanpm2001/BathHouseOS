# BathHouseOS

## UriOS

### About

UriOS is a subsystem of BathHouseOS, designed for making urinals a bit more advanced, although not much can be improved here, and I don't feel like merging just yet. Also, be careful when searching the name of this project in public (or in private) due to its similar pronunciation to Yuri (Japanese Lesbian genre) which may be sexualized in some or many cases, depending on if you have safe search set to strict, medium, or off.

### Features

#### Automatic flushing

Turn automatic flushing on and off

#### Flush direction

## Home repositories

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/UriOS/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main BathHouseOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
